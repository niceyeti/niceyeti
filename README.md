Thanks for looking! Niceyeti here, aka Jesse Waite. I am a fullstack software engineer involved in cloud development and an informatic security researcher specializing in neural counter-misinformation models and attack modeling.
My previous security research was in language modeling, anomaly detection in graphical processes (m. thesis), and graphical anomaly detection in power system cyber data (IEEE published).
Until recently I helped maintain big data cloud platforms and power system apps at Schweitzer Engineering Labs, where I worked for about 7 years.

I am currently learning Golang+Kubernetes devops through several projects:
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/niceyeti/tutornetes) operators and CRDs for development/security
* [Golang generic channel patterns library](https://github.com/niceyeti/channerics)
* Multilanguage counter-misinformation evaluation methods

Currently reading Endurance by Alfred Lansing, and swapping the engine on my old WRX, one of several mechanical projects of necessity and enjoyment.

LinkedIn devolved into a pseudo-facebook and I receive far too much recruiter spam, so I now only engage direct contacts.
This github account and its personal page are now my primary resume, but feel free to reach out or paypal me at jesse underscore waite at hotmail.
