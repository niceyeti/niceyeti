Niceyeti here, aka Jesse Waite. I am a fullstack software engineer involved in cloud development and an informatic security researcher specializing in neural counter-misinformation models.
My previous security research was in language modeling, anomaly detection in graphical processes (m. thesis), and graphical anomaly detection in power system cyber data (IEEE published).
Until recently I helped maintain big data cloud platforms and power system apps at Schweitzer Engineering Labs, where I worked for 7 years.

I'm currently learning Golang+Kubernetes devops through several projects:
* Kubernetes operators and CRDs for development/security
* Golang generic channel patterns library
* Multilanguage counter-misinformation evaluation methods (private)

Currently reading Endurance by Alfred Lansing, and swapping the engine on my old WRX, one of several mechanical projects of necessity and enjoyment.

Linkedin has devolved into a professional narcissism site, and I received way too much recruiter spam, so now I only engage direct contacts.
My github account is now my primary resume, but feel free to reach out at jesse underscore waite at hotmail.
