I'm niceyeti, aka Jesse Waite. I am a professional fullstack software engineer involved in cloud development and an informatic security researcher specializing in neural counter-misinformation models.
My previous security research was in language modeling, anomaly detection in graphical processes (m. thesis), and graphical anomaly detection in power system cyber data.
I currently work on big data / cloud platforms at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, where I have worked for 7 years.

I'm currently learning in Golang+Kubernetes with a few projects in the works:
* Kubernetes operators and CRDs for development/security
* Golang generic channel patterns library
* Multilanguage counter-misinformation evaluation methods (private)

I live in Pullman WA but am looking for roles in either golang/devops or machine learning research roles in security and languages.
I have previous experience in security, as well as significant cyber intelligence research experience, to which I have contributed open source methods.
I am a clean, hardworking, self-taught, professional developer originally from the trades, a leader as much as a terrific and supportive team mate.

Currently reading Endurance by Alfred Lansing, and swapping the engine on my old WRX, one of several mechanical projects of both necessity and enjoyment.

Linkedin has devolved into a social media site and I received too much recruiter spam, so now I only take direct contacts.
My github account is now my primary resume, but feel free to reach out at jesse_waite@hotmail.com.
I am easy to reach and always looking for a challenge!
